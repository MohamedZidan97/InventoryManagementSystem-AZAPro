        <h1>Welcome to the AZA Electronic Inventory Platform</h1>
        <p>We sincerely thank you for your trust in us. We fully recognize that merchants have certain rights, and AZA is committed to safeguarding the information of both merchants and consumers in accordance with our privacy policy and confidentiality mechanisms.</p>

        <p>This document serves to inform you of the privacy policy and confidentiality measures in place at AZA, as stipulated in the user agreement between you, the merchants, and AZA. According to Section Four of Article Fifteen of the user agreement, AZA has established these rules—“Privacy Policy and Confidentiality”—to clarify and define the confidentiality and privacy practices at AZA. Please take a moment to review them, as by accessing AZA, all your information will be subject to this policy.</p>

        <h2>Information Collected and Retained by AZA:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consumer Personal Information:</strong> Includes name, email address, national ID number, or residency number.</li>

            <li><strong>Store Information:</strong> Such as commercial registration number and a copy of the commercial registration.</li>
            <li><strong>Login Credentials for the Online Store:</strong> Including username, password, email address, security question, and answer. If a merchant does not provide the required information, AZA may seek to obtain it from other sources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information Related to Store Revenues or Goods/Services:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>AZA is continuously informed about the revenues generated in the store, as merchants utilize the payment gateways provided by AZA.</li>
            <li>AZA is aware of the types of goods or services displayed in the merchant's store.</li>
            <li>AZA monitors store performance to provide necessary support or guidance to merchants to help them improve.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information About Store Consumers or Clients:</h2>
        <p>To maintain and enhance the quality of merchant operations, AZA consistently monitors the number of consumers and clients associated with each store.</p>

        <h2>Sharing Information of Merchants:</h2>
        <p>AZA strives to retain this information while preserving merchant privacy. The platform only retains this information to improve the quality of the platform and facilitate merchants' operations. Generally, this information is only accessible to authorized personnel at AZA, who must obtain permission from AZA management to access it. This permission is usually limited and subject to legal and administrative oversight from AZA, ensuring that the information is not disclosed to third parties.</p>

        <h2>Security of Merchant, Consumer, and Store Information:</h2>
        <p>AZA is dedicated to protecting the confidentiality of user information. The privacy policy for merchants or stores does not conflict with the user agreement or existing privacy policies. However, given the inherent risks of online data security, the AZA team wishes to emphasize the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AZA seeks to ensure that all information pertaining to merchants is kept confidential and is not disclosed contrary to the policies in place.</li>
            <li>AZA implements high-quality electronic and technical security measures to protect merchant information, regularly updating these measures.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, as no system can guarantee 100% security against breaches or viruses, AZA advises merchants to maintain the utmost confidentiality of their critical information and not to disclose any sensitive data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategic and Logistical Services (Third-Party Services):</h2>
        <p>Merchants acknowledge that when applying for services provided by a third party, they grant AZA full permission to provide the service provider with their data. This includes username, personal phone number, email address, national ID or residency number, home address, and other relevant information needed for the service provider to fulfill the request.</p>

        <h2>Rules and Regulations for Using AZA:</h2>
        <p>All obligations of AZA, as well as those of the merchants, and all rights arising from the relationship between merchants and AZA are governed by this “Privacy Policy and Confidentiality.” This policy, stemming from the agreement established between merchants and AZA during the platform's creation, is designed to ensure the credibility and trust that AZA is committed to providing to merchants.</p>
